**RiboGalaxy**, a Galaxy-based platform for processing ribo-seq data from raw reads to genomic and transcriptomic alignments, is one of three `Riboseq.org <https://riboseq.org/>`_. resources. RiboGalaxy facilitates reproducible data analysis without any sophisticated environment setups for users and enables more accessible scientific discoveries. 

Here I share how to build a RiboGalaxy instance. Many steps include following tutorials from `Galaxy Admin Track 2021 <https://training.galaxyproject.org/archive/2021-08-01/topics/admin/>`_ with multiple changes in configuration. 

Check out the :doc:`Overview of installation process` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`hardware` the project.

   This project is under active development. If you notice any bugs, please don't hesitate to send an email to ribogalaxy@gmail.com.
